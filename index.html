    <p id="Biography"></p>

    Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.

    Trump's father, Fred, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. He started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15. Their company, "E. Trump & Son", founded in 1923, was active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, building and selling thousands
    of houses, barracks, and apartments. In spite of his German ancestry, Fred claimed to be Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II; Trump repeated this claim until the 1990s. Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Scotland.
    Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens. Trump grew up with three elder siblings – Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth – and younger brother Robert.

    At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school. In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. While at Wharton, he worked
    at the family business, Elizabeth Trump & Son, graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics. Profiles of Trump published in The New York Times in 1973 and 1976 erroneously reported that he had graduated first in his class at Wharton. However, he
    had never made the school's honor roll.

    Donald Trump is an American businessman, former television personality, and the 45th president of the United States. He began his real estate career at his father's company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which he later renamed the Trump Organization. He rose
    to public prominence after concluding a number of successful real estate deals in Manhattan and New York City, and his company now owns and develops lodging and golf courses around the world. Trump partly or completely owned several beauty pageants
    between 1996 and 2015. He has marketed his name to many building projects and commercial products. Trump's unsuccessful business ventures have included several casino and hotel bankruptcies, the folding of his New Jersey Generals football team, and
    the now-defunct Trump University. After being inaugurated as U.S. president in January 2017, Trump resigned all management roles within the Trump Organization, and delegated company management to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, in response to concerns
    about conflicts of interest. Trump retained his financial stake in the business.

    Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987, switched to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009. He made donations to both
    the Democratic and the Republican parties, party committees, and candidates until 2010 when he stopped donating to Democrats and increased his donations to Republicans considerably.

    Trump's first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), topped the New York Times Best Seller list for 13 weeks, and remained on the list for 48 weeks.According to The New Yorker, "The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image
    of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon." Co-author Tony Schwartz later said he did all the writing. Two further memoirs were published in 1990 and 1997. Trump's writings then shifted to financial tips and political opinion.
